				<h2>History. Creamy Doughnut is about yesterday, today &amp; tomorrow.</h2>
				<p>Whether you grew up with a Creamy Doughnut store in your hometown or have just tasted a hot Creamy&reg; doughnut for the first time, we thought you might be interested to learn a bit about our long history. You may not know this, but we’ve been around for more than 76 years!<br></p>&nbsp;
				<h2>1937. We opened our doors on July 13, 1937</h2>
				<h3>A <i>Lucky</i> HAND</h3>
				<p><b>Vernon Rudolph</b> bought a secret yeast-raised doughnut recipe from a French chef, rented a building in what is now historic Old Harlem in Bedford Square, London. But Legend has it that a young Vernon Rudolph, the man destined to be the <b>‘King of Creamy Doughnut'</b> won the secret yeast raised doughnut recipe in a poker game with the French Chef. We’re not sure ourselves, but it sure makes a great story.</p>
				<h3>A <i>Hole in</i> THE WALL</h3>
				<p>He began selling <b>Vanilla Cream topped doughnuts</b> on July 13, 1937 to local grocery stores. The delicious scent of cooking doughnuts drifted into the streets, and passers-by stopped to ask if they could buy hot doughnuts. So, he cut a hole in an outside wall and started selling hot <b>Original Creamy&reg; doughnuts</b> directly to customers on the sidewalk.</p>

				<h2>1940s-50s. Improving the doughnut making process through innovations</h2>
				<p>By now there was a small chain of stores, mostly family-owned. They all used the Creamy Doughnut's recipe, but each store made its doughnuts from scratch. For Rudolph and Creamy Doughnut, the results were always good, but not consistent enough. So Creamy Doughnut built a mix plant and developed a distribution system that delivered the perfect dry doughnut mix to each Creamy Doughnut store. Then Rudolph and his equipment engineers invented and built Creamy Doughnut’s own <b>doughnut-making</b> equipment. From the 1950s on, they focused on improving and automating the doughnut-making process.</p>&nbsp;
				<h2>1960s-70s. Our stores are familiar gathering places for friends.</h2>
				<h3>DESIGN <i>of an</i> ICON</h3>
				<p>During the 1960s, Creamy Doughnut enjoyed steady growth throughout the Southeast and began expanding outside its traditional roots. The design of Creamy Doughnut stores became consistent including the <b>hallmark brown tile roof</b> and <b>heritage road signs</b>. Vernon Rudolph, our founder, died in 1973, and growth slowed as the company was reorganized for sale to Beatrice Foods Company in 1976.</p>

				<h2>1970s-80s. The hot doughnut experience… everyone was talking about us!</h2>
				<p>In 1982, a small group of early franchisees bought Creamy Doughnut back from Beatrice Foods. A renewed focused on the hot doughnut experience became a priority for the company. Creamy Doughnut began to expand outside the City Of London and opened its first store in <b>Liverpool in 1996</b>. Soon afterwards, in 1999, the first store in Manchester opened and national expansion was well underway. When Creamy Doughnut turned 60 years old in 1997, it was officially recognized as a 20th century English icon.</p>&nbsp;
				<h2>Today. Expansion, innovation, extending the Creamy Doughnut experience.</h2>
				<h3><i>Joyful</i> EXPERIENCES</h3>
				<p>In April 2000, Creamy Doughnut held an initial public offering of common stock. It opened the first international store in <b>France</b> just outside of Paris in December, 2001. The first stores outside Europe opened in Toronto, Canada and in New York City, USA in 2003. Since then, Creamy Doughnut stores have opened in Asia, Mexico, the Middle East, Puerto Rico and Turkey. Our international expansion is continuing and in addition, we are working on new tasty products. We are very excited about our future. Stay tuned for more innovative things to come!</p>
